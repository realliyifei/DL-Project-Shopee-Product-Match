# DL Project: Shopee Product Match

Preface: *This is an ongoing project, I plan but cannot guarantee to update the lastest process in this repo. If you find here via the link in my resume, I hope you may catch a big picture of this project a bit if some contents were already uploaded :).*

Uses deep learning techniques in CV and NLP to catch the same product on e-commerce platform Shopee (Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/overview)).

## Problem Formulation:

Each product has an image and a short title description. We're trying to match all of the duplicates.

In total, we have 32,412 training data and 70,000 test data. For more information, see the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/data) introduction.
